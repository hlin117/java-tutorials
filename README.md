java-tutorials
==============

This is a set of exercises I've created to help novice users to learn basic syntax to java, basic function syntax, and recursion.

The reason why I chose these topics over the (many) other topics a programming class would offer is because understanding these topics is necessary in discrete mathematics - which some students take concurrently with their first programming class. These students are at a slight disadvantage at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, so I cater to this crowd rather than the general public.

For now, I do not plan to write a section about object oriented program, which I understand is a vital aspect to java (as well as computer science in general). However, I don't believe it would be too difficult to write exercises on this topic.

This set of exercises finshes off by having students help write their own basic selection sort, as well as have students finish writing a mergesort and quicksort. These sorting functions are part of the pinnicle examples of recursive algorithms, and it would be a shame to not stress them on beginning computer science students.
