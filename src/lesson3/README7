basics7 is the first instance where while-loops and flags are used.

Most of the time, while-loops are used to continuously perform an operation
indefinitely until a certain (boolean) condition is fulfilled. We would check whether
this condition is satisfied simply by

	while(condition)

while-loops can often be interchanged with "do-while" loops, which we won't cover here.

The next kind of tool we use is a "flag". In simple terms, the flag is the condition
that needs to be fulfilled in order for the program to exit out of the while-loop.

Together, flags and while-loops are excellent tools to force a user to 
honor a program's condition.
