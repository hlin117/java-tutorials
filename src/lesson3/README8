basics8 introduces the second kind of loop into the mix: the for-loop.

While I would suggest using a while-loop to perform a set of operations
*indefinitely* until a certain condition is fulfilled, for-loops are
excellent loops in case someone needs to perform a certain operation for a
known, *definite* number of times.

For example, to print out (on separate lines) the numbers between 0 through 9 
(a "definite" number of times), you would only need the lines of code below:

	for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
		TextIO.putln(i);
	}
	
where
	"int i = 0" initializes i to zero
	"i < 10" is the condition/boolean that needs to be fulfilled
	"i++" indicates by how much we change i (in this case, 1 each time)
	
First note the condition is checked every time before the inner loop is executed,
even for the first time. (So sometimes the code inside might not ever be executed!)
Second, if someone wanted to print the numbers between 1 through 10, you would need
to modify the loop to be:

	for(int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
		TextIO.putln(i);
	}
	
(other solutions exist, of course).
