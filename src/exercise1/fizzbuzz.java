	 * The fizzbuzz test.
	 * 
	 * Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. 
	 * But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and 
	 * for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. 
	 * For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”."
	 * 
	 * For example, these are the first 5 numbers and 15
	 * 
	 * 1
	 * 2
	 * fizz
	 * 4
	 * buzz
	 * ...
	 * 15 fizzbuzz
	 * 
	 * HINT: To check whether a number x is divisible by (or a multiple of) a number n,
	 * perform the following code:
	 * 
	 * if(x % n == 0)
	 *     ... do stuff here...
	 *     
	 * where % is the modulo operator.
	 *
